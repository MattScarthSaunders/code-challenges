# Solaris

This code challenge was to replicate the retro movie poster for the film 'Solaris' using only plain html, css and js.

# To see it:

You can compare the brief to the result by opening `originalposter.webp` (...the original) and `result_screenshot.png` (the result of the challenge...) or if you have vs-code or similar with a `live server` extension, you can select the index.html and run that to view it in all it's glory in the browser.
