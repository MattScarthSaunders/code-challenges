# Darkest mode

This was made as a code challenge in which I was to make a chrome extension - it could be anything, but there was a time limit of 2 hours to plan, build and deploy the extension.

It adds an overlay to the browser, shrouding everything in darkness, but luckily also adds a torch effect to your cursor, so you can still navigate the web as usual...just...darker.
