# Darkest mode

This was made as a code challenge in which I was to make a chrome extension - it could be anything, but there was a time limit of 2 hours to plan, build and deploy the extension.

It adds an overlay to the browser, shrouding everything in darkness, but luckily also adds a torch effect to your cursor, so you can still navigate the web as usual...just...darker.

# To run it locally

- Clone the repo to a new directory
- Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
- Click `Load unpacked`
- Select the darkest_mode directory you created
- Make sure it's activated in the browser and enjoy!

Note: the effect works best on light-mode sites as, just like in real-life, shining a torch on a black wall doesn't do much.
